## What is SoloCorp OS?

SoloCorp OS is an **organizational operating system for AI agents**. It
transforms a single AI into a structured, multi-department company of
specialized agents — each with a dedicated Head, defined responsibilities,
and a clear chain of command.

The core insight: instead of asking one AI to do everything (which means
nobody is responsible for anything), SoloCorp OS divides work into 18 departments + R&D Lab,
each led by a Department Head who owns outcomes. Department
Heads delegate execution to specialist sub-agents and communicate with
other departments through structured handoffs.

Key metrics at a glance:

| Dimension | Value |
|:----------|:------|
| Departments | 18 (C-Level + System + Product + Revenue + Legal + Web3 + Content + NetEng + CyberSec + Psychology) |
| Department Heads | 18 |
| Specialist Agents | 55+ (across 18 departments) |
| Skills Integration | 93 skills |
| Pipeline Commands | 8 |
| Platforms | Hermes, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot |
| Runtime | Loop Runner (cron every 30 min) |
| Central Bus | Production Ready (FastAPI v0.6, port 8099) |
| Status | Production Deployed |

---

## Core Philosophy

SoloCorp OS is built on three non-negotiable pillars:

**1. Department Heads Do Not Work Themselves**

The Head's job is to lead — set direction, make decisions, resolve
blockers, and escalate when necessary. Execution belongs to specialist
sub-agents. If a Head is writing code or designing UIs, the system is
broken.

**2. Leadership & Management Skills**

Every Department Head must be skilled in delegation, team management,
cross-department communication, and strategic thinking. Technical
expertise is table stakes; leadership is the differentiator.

**3. Ownership Mindset**

Every Head is the owner of their department, not an employee. They own
outcomes, quality, and continuous improvement. There is no "not my job"
in SoloCorp OS.

---

## Why This Architecture?

The problem with most AI agent systems is they suffer from a single point
of failure — one orchestrator that must route everything, remember
everything, and execute everything. This creates:

- **Bottlenecks** — Every request waits for the orchestrator
- **Context loss** — One agent cannot hold context for all domains
- **No accountability** — When everything is everyone's job, nothing gets owned

SoloCorp OS solves this with:

| Problem | Solution |
|:--------|:---------|
| Single orchestrator bottleneck | Head-to-Head handoff — 80% of cases go direct |
| No domain expertise | 18 specialized departments + R&D Lab with deep knowledge |
| Context loss | Each Head owns their domain context |
| Orphan work | Every task has an owner at every step |
| Slow execution | Data Layer bypasses Heads entirely |

---

## Hierarchy Structure

The chain of command flows from Human through CEO to C-Level, then to
Department Heads, and finally to Specialist Teams:

```
Dr.solodev (Human / Owner)
  └── CEO — เทอโบ (Turbo Chaisriram)
       │    Vision, Strategy, Final Decision
       │
       ├── CFO — meetoo                    Finance, Budget, Investment
       ├── CMO — มาร์ค                      Marketing, Content, Brand
       └── Orchestrator — พี่วุฒิ (Wut)     System Pipeline Coordination
            │
            └── Department Heads (05-18)
                 ├── 05-Architect     — พี่ทรงศักดิ์   — Central Bus
                 ├── 06-Product       — โปรดัค        — Roadmap / PRD
                 ├── 07-Engineering   — ช่างฟูล        — Code / Architecture
                 ├── 08-Design        — ครีเอท         — UX / Brand Visual
                 ├── 09-UI Designer   — UI Designer    — Interface
                 ├── 10-QA            — QA-ทีม         — Testing / Quality
                 ├── 11-Sales         — เซลส์          — B2B Pipeline
                 ├── 12-Support       — ซัพพอร์ต       — Customer Success
                 ├── 13-Legal         — ตุลย์           — Compliance / Law
                 ├── 14-Web3          — อัยวา          — Blockchain / DeFi
                 ├── 15-Content       — เสก            — Content / Creative
                 ├── 16-NetEng        — นีต            — Network / Infrastructure
                 ├── 17-CyberSec      — ซาย            — Security / Threat / IR
                 └── 18-Psychology    — จิต            — Behavior / Econ / Org
```

Communication rules:

- Human speaks only to CEO
- CEO commands C-Level (CFO, CMO, Orchestrator)
- Orchestrator coordinates Department Heads
- Department Heads speak to each other directly (Head-to-Head)
- Heads delegate execution to specialist sub-agents
- Sub-agents NEVER communicate with other departments directly

---

## Two-Tier Architecture

The system separates information flow into two distinct layers:

**Control Layer (Head-to-Head)**

This is the visible management layer. Department Heads communicate
status updates, approvals, exceptions, and handoffs. This layer is
deliberately lightweight — only what's needed for coordination.

```
  Head A ──(status/report)──→ Head B
    ↑                            ↑
    │  Minimal, structured       │
    │  communication only        │
```

**Data Layer (Autonomous via Central Bus)**

This is where actual work happens. Specialist agents write code, produce
designs, generate reports, and create documents — all flowing through the
Central Bus automatically. Heads never need to pass files around; they
simply see "Work Item X completed."

```
  Specialist A ──(write)──→ CENTRAL BUS ──(notify)──→ Specialist B
```

**Why this matters:**

| Aspect | Without Two-Tier | With Two-Tier |
|:-------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| Speed | Blocked by Head availability | Work flows autonomously |
| Scalability | Heads become bottlenecks | Heads stay strategic |
| Audit | Manual tracking | Central Bus logs everything |
| Resilience | Head failure stops work | Sub-agents continue executing |

## Department Responsibilities

| # | Department | Head | Core Function | Team Size |
|:-:|:-----------|:-----|:--------------|:---------:|
| 01 | CEO | เทอโบ | Vision, Strategy, Final Decision | 0 |
| 02 | CFO | meetoo | Finance, Budget, Investment | 3 |
| 03 | CMO | มาร์ค | Marketing, Content, Brand | 3 |
| 04 | Orchestrator | พี่วุฒิ | Cross-Dept Pipeline Coordination | 3 |
| 05 | Architect | พี่ทรงศักดิ์ | Central Bus, Routing, Monitoring | 5 |
| 06 | Product | โปรดัค | Feature Roadmap, PRD, Delivery | 3 |
| 07 | Engineering | ช่างฟูล | Backend, Frontend, Architecture | 3 |
| 08 | Design | ครีเอท | UX Research, Brand Visual | 3 |
| 09 | UI Designer | UI Designer | Interface, Component Library | 3 |
| 10 | QA | QA-ทีม | Testing, Quality, Evidence | 3 |
| 11 | Sales | เซลส์ | B2B Deal Strategy, Pipeline | 3 |
| 12 | Support | ซัพพอร์ต | Customer Success, Analytics | 3 |
| 13 | Legal | ตุลย์ | Compliance, Contracts, Law | 3 |
| 14 | Web3 | อัยวา | Blockchain, DeFi, Solana | 4 |
| 15 | Content Creator | เสก | Content, Creative, Media | 10 refs |
| 16 | Network Engineer | นีต | Network, Infrastructure, VPN, CDN, DNS | 3 |
| 17 | Cyber Security | ซาย | Threat Detection, Vulnerability, Incident Response | 3 |
| 18 | Psychology | จิต | User Behavior, Behavioral Economics, Org Psychology | 3 |

Each department has between 3-5 specialist agents who execute the
actual work. Department Heads do not execute — they lead, prioritize,
and make decisions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Access to Hermes Agent Gateway (or OpenCode CLI)
- Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dr-SoloDev/Lab-solocorp-os2.4.git
cd Lab-solocorp-os2.4
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Interface

**Option A: OpenCode (Recommended)**

OpenCode is the primary CLI interface for SoloCorp OS. The `opencode.json`
configuration includes all 21 agents and 8 pipeline commands.

```bash
opencode
```

Default agent is the CEO (เทอโบ). Speak naturally and the CEO will route
you to the correct department. Or use @mention to go direct:

```bash
opencode "@architect-songsak design a pipeline for the billing feature"
opencode "@changful implement user registration API endpoint"
opencode "@cfo-meetoo วิเคราะห์ผลประกอบการ Q3"
opencode "@product-produck review the new feature PRD"
```

**Option B: Codex CLI**

Export all profiles as Codex CLI sub-agents:

```bash
python3 scripts/export-codex-agents.py
codex
```

**Option C: Hermes Gateway**

All 18 department profiles + R&D Lab are deployed to Hermes Gateway and ready for use through
Hermes profiles system at `~/.hermes/profiles/<NN-name>/`.

### Step 3: Run a Pipeline Command

```bash
opencode "/pipeline billing-system-v2"
opencode "/status"
opencode "/audit pipeline"
```

### Step 4: Explore the Codebase

Start with these key files:

| File | Why Read It |
|:-----|:------------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | System design, principles, and data flow |
| `profiles/INDEX.md` | Complete index of all agents and their status |
| `profiles/01-ceo/SOUL.md` | CEO profile — see how a Head operates |
| `profiles/05-architect/` | Most complete department with 5 sub-agents |
| `opencode.json` | Full OpenCode configuration |

## How Work Flows Through the System

Understanding the end-to-end flow helps make sense of why the system
is structured the way it is:

```
  PHASE 1: Intake
  ───────────────
  Human ──→ CEO ──→ Understand request ──→ Route to correct department

  PHASE 2: Planning
  ─────────────────
  Department Head receives brief
    → Delegates to specialist sub-agent(s)
    → Sub-agent researches, plans, and proposes

  PHASE 3: Execution
  ──────────────────
  Sub-agent executes the work
    → Output written to Central Bus
    → Head notified only on completion
    → If blocked → escalate to Head

  PHASE 4: Handoff (if cross-department)
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  Head A sends structured handoff to Head B
    → Pipeline Auditor logs the handoff
    → Head B receives and delegates to their team

  PHASE 5: Delivery
  ─────────────────
  Work completed → Central Bus notifies all stakeholders
    → QA validates quality gate
    → Head signs off
    → CEO reports completion to Human
```

## Recommended Learning Path

For newcomers who want to understand the system thoroughly:

1. **Read this file** (you're here now)
2. **Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`** — understand the design principles
3. **Browse `profiles/INDEX.md`** — see all agents and their status
4. **Study `profiles/01-ceo/SOUL.md`** — understand how a Head profile works
5. **Study `profiles/05-architect/`** — see the most complete department
6. **Open `opencode.json`** — understand the full configuration
7. **Run `/status`** — see the system in action
8. **Submit a request** — experience the pipeline live

---

## Key Principles to Remember

- **Department Heads do not work** — they lead, delegate, and decide
- **Communication is structured** — Heads talk to Heads, sub-agents execute
- **Data flows autonomously** — Central Bus handles artifacts, not Heads
- **Handoffs are explicit** — every work transition is logged and auditable
- **Escalation is rare** — 80% of cases resolve through direct Head-to-Head
- **Status is published** — never wait to ask "what's the status"

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I talk directly to a sub-agent?**
A: No. All communication goes through Department Heads. Sub-agents receive
tasks from their Head and report back. This maintains clean accountability.

**Q: What if I don't know which department I need?**
A: Talk to the CEO (เทอโบ). The CEO will understand your request and route
it to the correct department.

**Q: How do I escalate a blocked task?**
A: If a sub-agent is blocked, they escalate to their Department Head. If the
Head cannot resolve it, they escalate to the Orchestrator (พี่วุฒิ). Critical
issues go to the CEO.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Yes. All 18 departments + R&D Lab and their specialist agents are deployed and
active on Hermes Gateway. The Loop Runner operates on cron. The Central Bus
is the only major component still in design.
