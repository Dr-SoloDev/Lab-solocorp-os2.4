# 🏃 Sprint 2: Master Synthesis — Integration

**Owner:** CEO เทอโบ  
**Start:** 2026-07-27  
**Duration:** 2 สัปดาห์ (Sprint 2-3 จาก Master Synthesis timeline)  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Execution Mode:** Hybrid — CEO direct + COO dispatch + Department Heads

---

## Context

Sprint 1 (Clear Overdue) dispatched 7 tasks + 1 WP. Evidence shows **LLM timeout** in agent worker pipeline — agents received tasks but couldn't produce deep results via `opencode run --pure`. 

**Sprint 2 approach:**
- CEO (ผม) execute high-value cognitive work directly in-session
- COO (Kit) handles routing, triage, monitoring
- Department Heads receive clear briefs for async execution
- Evidence collected manually per deliverable
