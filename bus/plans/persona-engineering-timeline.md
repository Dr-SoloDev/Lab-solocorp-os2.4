|:---|:-----------|:-------|
| WP2 | WP1 | Validation schema must match new template structure |
| WP3 | WP1, WP2 | Smoke test questions need template fields + validation criteria |
| WP4 | WP1 | Evolution system appends to 5-Layer persona files |
| WP5 | — | Standalone tool review (no code dependency) |
| WP6 | — | Standalone privacy scanner port |
| WP7 | WP1, WP2, WP3, WP4, WP5, WP6 | Compare mode consumes all upgraded profiles + quality data |

## 5. WP7: Compare Mode — Specification

**Owner:** @orchestrator-wut (พี่วุฒิ)
**Dept:** Orchestrator
**Depends on:** WP1 → WP6 complete
**Output:** `/compare` command spec + prototype

### 5.1 Concept

Port the `/compare` prompt concept from `teammate-skill/prompts/compare.md` to SoloCorp's Department Head context. Instead of comparing generic teammates, we compare **Department Heads** side-by-side to answer routing/handoff questions:

- "Who should handle this task?"
- "Which department is best suited for this goal?"
- "How would Songsak vs Kreet approach this problem?"
- "Should this pipeline route to Design or Product first?"

### 5.2 Comparison Inputs

For each Department Head, the compare mode reads:

| Data Source | Field | Purpose |
|:------------|:------|:--------|
| `profiles/NN-name/SOUL.md` | Layer 0 Core Rules | Hard constraints (what they will/won't do) |
| | Layer 1 Identity | Role, reports to, team size |
| | Layer 2 Communication | Catchphrases, speaking style |
| | Layer 3 Decision | Priority ranking, pushback pattern |
| | Model Spec | Model tier, capability domain |
| | Core Discipline | 5 pillars of their discipline |
| | KPI | Success metrics |
| `scripts/validate-soul-profiles.py` | Quality score | Validation pass/fail per criterion |
| `brain/version_manager.py` | Evolution history | Recent updates, expertise growth |
| Central Bus | Routing history | Past handoff patterns, SLA data |

### 5.3 Comparison Modes

#### Mode A: Quick Overview (no context)

Command: `/compare [dept-A] vs [dept-B]`

Output: Compact table with contrasting dimensions:

```
━━━ @architect-songsak vs @design-kreet ━━━

                     Architect (Songsak)         Design (Kreet)
Role:                Head of Architect           Creative Director
Model:               DeepSeek V4 Pro (Tier A)    GLM-5.2 (Tier B)
Priority:            Pipeline Integrity > Speed  Consistency > Novelty
Decision Style:      Systematic, rule-based      Intuitive, principle-based
Pushback:            "Show me the data"          "This violates design system"
Catchphrase:         "Simpler is better"         "Every pixel has a reason"
Domain:              Pipeline, Bus, Routing      Brand, Visual, UX

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### Mode B: Routing Decision

Command: `/compare [dept-A] vs [dept-B] for "[task description]"`

When the orchestrator needs to decide routing:

1. Parse task description for domain keywords
2. Match against each department's scope (Layer 1 + Core Discipline)
3. Simulate each Head's response (2-3 sentences in character)
4. Recommend routing with rationale

```
🤔 "Who should handle: 'Design a pipeline monitoring dashboard'?"

@architect-songsak would:
  "I'll route this through Pipeline Auditor — they own monitoring specs
   and health probes. Expected: dashboard mockup in 1 day."
  → Direct ownership, fast turnaround, within scope

@design-kreet would:
  "Happy to make it look beautiful, but I need UX requirements from
   the user first. Who's the audience? What decisions will they make?"
  → Would add design thinking but slower due to discovery phase

Recommendation: @architect-songsak for build, @design-kreet review for UX polish.
```

#### Mode C: Handoff Conflict Resolution

When two departments both claim (or reject) a task:

```
🎭 Conflict: "Both Engineering and Architect claim ownership of deployment pipeline."

@architect-songsak: "Pipeline design is my mandate — I own Central Bus.
                     Engineering implements what I route."
@engineering-changful: "I write the code that makes pipelines run.
                        Architect designs the theory, I build the practice."

Orchestrator resolution:
  → Architect: Design pipeline topology + routing rules
  → Engineering: Implement pipeline code + deploy
  → Handoff: Architect routes → Engineering builds → QA validates
```

### 5.4 Data Flow for Compare Mode

```
Input: /compare [A] vs [B] [optional: "for <task>"]

1. Load both profiles/SOUL.md
2. Extract comparison dimensions (Layer 0-3, Model, KPIs)
3. If task provided:
   a. Parse task domain keywords
   b. Score relevance per department scope
   c. Simulate response for each (in-character)
   d. Recommend routing
4. Render compact comparison table
5. Output to Central Bus as handoff advisory
```

### 5.5 Compare Mode Command Spec

```
/compare <dept-slug-a> vs <dept-slug-b> [for "<task description>"]
/compare all for "<task description>"           # compare all relevant depts
/compare <dept-a> <dept-b> <dept-c>             # 3-way comparison
```

### 5.6 Prototype Plan

| Step | What | Output |
|:-----|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | Read all 18 SOUL.md → extract comparison dimensions | `scripts/compare-dimensions.yaml` |
| 2 | Build `/compare` prompt template | `prompts/compare-prompts.md` |
| 3 | Implement comparison scoring for routing | `scripts/routing-compare.py` |
| 4 | Wire to `/deploy` as advisory step | `opencode.json` routing update |
| 5 | Test with 3 scenarios (clear, ambiguous, conflict) | Test report |

### 5.7 Acceptance Criteria

- `/compare A vs B` produces a compact table with ≥5 contrasting dimensions
- `/compare A vs B for "task"` produces a routing recommendation + rationale
- Response is in-character for both Department Heads
- Handles 3+ department comparison in table format
- Falls back gracefully if profile data is incomplete (marks missing fields)

## 6. Risk Register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|:-:|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|:------|
| R1 | WP1 template doesn't cover all 18 profiles | Medium | High | Design to produce template + migrate 2 pilot profiles first before bulk | @design-kreet |
| R2 | WP2 validation script blocks WIP profiles (false positives) | Medium | Medium | Allow per-profile overrides; manual review queue set up before W2 end | @architect-songsak |
| R3 | WP3 smoke tests fail on valid profiles (false negatives) | Medium | Medium | Tune prompts per department role; run in non-blocking mode first week | @qa |
| R4 | WP4 version merge conflicts with existing brain/ data | Low | High | Test merge on a fork of brain/ first; keep full backup before upgrade | @architect-songsak |
| R5 | WP5 collector scripts don't match SoloCorp workflow (e.g. no real Slack API) | Medium | Low | Scope down to supported sources only (GitHub PRs, local files); defer unsupported | @content-creator-sek |
| R6 | WP6 privacy scanner flags too many false positives | Medium | Medium | Tune regex rules for SoloCorp context; allow whitelist-based exemptions | @legal-tulya |
| R7 | WP7 compare mode has no data to compare (other WPs slip) | Low | Critical | WP7 start is W4 — acts as buffer; if earlier WPs slip, adjust WP7 scope to design-only | @orchestrator-wut |
| R8 | WPs overlap contention (Songsak owns WP2 + WP4 simultaneously) | High | Medium | WP4 design spec done in W1 (idle); WP2 coding W1-W2 → WP4 coding W2-W3 — sequential pipeline | @orchestrator-wut |
| R9 | Owner (Dr.solodev) unavailable for final sign-off | Low | High | CEO (เทอโบ) has delegated authority for all gates except G6 | CEO |

## 7. Escalation Path

```
Gate issues → Report to Orchestrator (พี่วุฒิ)
  ├── Resolvable at WP level → Orchestrator coordinates fix
  ├── Cross-department conflict → Orchestrator mediates + handoff table
  └── Blocking / scope change → Escalate to CEO (เทอโบ) with recommendation
```

---

## 8. Success Criteria

- All 7 WPs delivered within 4 weeks
- Every gate passes with sign-off from CEO
- No handoff requires >1 round of clarification
- WP7 compare mode correctly recommends routing for ≥3 test scenarios
- Risk register: ≤1 high-severity risk realized (and mitigated within 24h)
